Flip-ui
=======

Flip|ui is a J2ME UI toolkit that adds a number of custom components to those available in LCDUI. The currently added components
are a custom animated animated splash screen, a grid supporting vertical and horizontal layout, a star rater, a J2ME slide show
component and a dynamic image loader that lazy loads images from their remote locations while displaying the downloading status.

These components are all heavily customizable.
